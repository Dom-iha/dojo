## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)
- For styles
  - [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
  - CSS modules

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me get started with react and understand the basics. I'd recommend it to anyone trying  to learn.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN contains a lot of useful information and is a great resource for learning about web development.

## Acknowledgments

To get started, Run the following command:

```bash
with npm:
  npm create vite@latest

with yarn:
  yarn create vite
```

Then, you can run the client:

```bash
