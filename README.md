### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me get started with react and understand the basics. I'd recommend it to anyone trying  to learn.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN contains a lot of useful information and is a great resource for learning about web development.
